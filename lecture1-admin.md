    - problem diary marked at workshop
  - weekly problem set
  - contests

Assessment Breakdown:
  - 40%:  Weekly problem sets (on vjudge) (documented via problem diary)
    - PS = 1ps, CR = 2ps, DN = 3ps, HD = 4ps
  - 8%:   Problem diary (on formatif)
  - 18%:  Contests (week 1, week 5 and week 9; 3 problems each)
  - 34%:  Final (7 problems over 5 hours)
  NB:     Course has NO DEADLINES.

Problem Diary:
  - documents weekly problem sets
  - written on formatif, submitted/marked in workshop
